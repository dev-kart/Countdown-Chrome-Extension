# Year Countdown Chrome Extension

A cool Chrome extension that shows a countdown to the end of the year with **light and dark mode** support. It updates in real time and automatically adjusts based on the user's system theme preference.

## Features:

- **Real-time Countdown**: Displays the time left until the end of the year (days, hours, minutes, seconds).
- **Dynamic Background**: Changes based on the current theme (light or dark).
- **Futuristic Font**: Uses the "Orbitron" font to give a space-age vibe.
- **Current Date**: Displays today's date with the full day of the week (e.g., "Monday, December 14, 2024").
- **Smooth Animation**: Page fades in when the new tab is opened.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Installation:

1. **Download the Files**: Download the full project files (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) to your local machine.
2. **Set Up Your Chrome Extension**:
   - Open **Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in the top right corner).
   - Click on **Load unpacked** and select the folder with the project files.
3. **Use the Extension**: Open a new tab to see the countdown to the New Year with light/dark mode options.
